Analytics for WordPress lets you integrate more than 100 analytics and marketing tools with the flick of a switch.


== Description ==

Analytics for WordPress is the easiest way to integrate analytics and marketing tools into your WordPress site.

Instead of installing each tool individually, just install Attribution's WordPress plugin and use Attribution to integrate third-party analytics and marketing tools.   Once you're setup, you can swap and add new analytics services with the flick of a switch!

Here's how it works:
* Install the Attribution plugin
* Attribution will automatically start tracking how people are using your site – what pages they view and the information they provide to you, like their emails
* Go to the Attribution control panel, and toggle on any tool you want to try like Google Analytics, KISSmetrics and Facebook Audiences
* Attribution will send this data along to each tool
* The service is fully integrated into your site–zero code required!
